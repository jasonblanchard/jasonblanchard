### Hi there, I'm Jason ðŸ‘‹

I'm a builder at heart who loves working across the stack[^1]. I get immense joy from seeing things work _____

âš¡ Things that have inspired me:
- [Evolutionary Architecture]([url](https://evolutionaryarchitecture.com/))[^2] - introduced the first principle of software architecture for me which is that there is no such thing as a perfect system, only systems that are more or less fit for their environments. Our job as software architects is to iteratively make our systems more fit for their environment, w.r.t. both the technical landscape and the business drivers. This is the "what" behind software architecture.
- [Simple Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) - the second principle of sotware architecture is simplicity, but a very specific kind of simplicity. Not necessarily "easier" or "more familiar" or "with less stuff," but more "decomplected," or "less interleaved/intertwined". This is the most basic "how" of software architecture.
- Refactoring UI

Talks I've given:
- LeadDev
- Deserted Island DevOps

ðŸ”­ Tools 'n things I'm excited about right now:


[^1]: Seriously. I have probably shipped just as much code for React frontends as I have the APIs that back them and the infrastructure that runs it all :)
[^2]: Up to but very much excluding the "microservice everything" recommendation. That's _one_ way, [but not the _only_ way]([url](https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity)).

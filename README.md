# Hi there, I'm [Jason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonwblanchard/) ðŸ‘‹

I am a builder who loves working across the stack[^1]. I get immense joy from putting things together and seeing them work, "things" being features, bug fixes, systems, teams, companies, and everything in between.

## ðŸŒ± Things that have inspired me
- [**Evolutionary Architecture**](https://evolutionaryarchitecture.com/)[^2] - theoretical underpinning for what has become my first principle of software architecture: there is no such thing as a perfect system, only systems that are more or less fit for their environments. Our job as software architects is to iteratively make our systems more fit for their environment, w.r.t. both the technical landscape and the business drivers. This is the "what" and the "why" behind software architecture.
- [**Simple Made Easy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) - inspired the second principle of sotware architecture, which is: **simplicity**. But! It's a very specific kind of simplicity. Not necessarily "easier" or "more familiar" or "with less stuff," but more "decomplected," or "less interleaved/intertwined". This is the most fundamental "how" of software architecture.

## :sweat_smile: Talks I've given
- [Everything is a Migration: Putting Evolutionary Architecture into Practice](https://leaddev.com/new-york/leaddev/video/2023/everything-migration-putting-evolutionary-architecture-practice) - LeadDev NYC 2023
- [Building the Right Island: What Should I Be Doing Right Now?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edJD_QUp-WE&list=PLVUQjiv8GtwJeezuKvmL2kl6I9Gml0g2a&index=3) - Deserted Island DevOps Â· Sep 27, 2022

## ~:wrench: Tools I'm excited about right now~
I was initially excited to write this section, but I decided to scrap it because it changes too often! The inspiration section :arrow_up: is far more evergreen and drives what tech I'm excited about at any given moment.

[^1]: Seriously. I have probably shipped just as much code for React frontends as I have the APIs that back them and the infrastructure that runs it all :)
[^2]: Up to but very much excluding the "microservice everything" recommendation. That's _one_ way, [but not the _only_ way](https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity).
